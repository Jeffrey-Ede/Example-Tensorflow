# Example-Tensorflow
Example training with TensorFlow

This repository is for an example TensorFlow script. It showcases the use of a convolution stack to remove salt and pepper noise (speckles of white and black) from images. This network is meant to be a minimal example that showcases basic machine learning concepts.

Unlike other minimal TensorFlow example scripts, this example is laid out with all the general purpose code needed to train complex neural networks. It is divided into functional sections appropriate for general purpose neural network training. From top to bottom, the sections are:

* Network building blocks
* Network architecture
* Experiment setup
* Data pipeline
* Utilty functions
* Main function that coordinates training
